ICS4U OOP Dates Assignment

Create a simple class named "Dates" that has the following properties and operations ...
Properties: (make these private)
year (an integer value)
month (an integer value)
day (an integer value)
Operations: (make these public)
A "void" method called "setDate" that takes three integer parameters to set the year, month, and day properties.
A method called "DateString" that returns a string containing the Friendly Text version of the date.
For example, if year=2025, month=1 and day=28, the string which is returned is "January 28, 2025"
A "void" method called "printDate" that prints the Friendly Text version of the date.
hint: use the DateString() function to do this
Save this class to a file called "Date.java" (make sure there is NOT a main() function in this file), then test the class out in a sample program .
PART B:
Now create two constructor functions ...
Dates( )
which initializes year=2002, month=1, day=1
Dates( int y, int m, int d)
which initializes year , month and day to the values supplied by the parameters y, m and d
Update this class and save the file called "Date.java" (make sure there is NOT a main() function in this file), then test the class out in a sample program .
